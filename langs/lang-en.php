<a href="http://www.boonex.com/products/dolphin/">Dolphin Smart Community Builder</a> is developed by <a href="http://www.boonex.com/">BoonEx Community Software Experts</a>.<br><br> 
<a href="http://www.boonex.com/products/dolphin/">Dolphin</a> Smart Community Builder is based on aeDating, the most popular dating software on the internet. Since the first Dolphin version was released on May 2006, it has been modernized, supplemented, improved considerably and become an even more popular Community software than the aeDating script was.<br> 
In conformity with the <a href="http://www.boonex.com/mission/">"Unite People"</a> mission, BoonEx strongly believes that Community software should be offered free of charge, since the Community unites people of different cultures, nationalities and races.<br><br>
BoonEx carries out its mission through <a href="http://www.boonex.com/products/dolphin/">Dolphin</a> (by improving it constantly and releasing new versions called the latest and modern technologies) but through the <a href="http://www.boonex.com/unity/">Unity - the Community of Communities</a> (by supporting Unity where webmasters and web developers can communicate with each other to share their knowledges and experience).<br>
BoonEx has worked in the software market since 2001. From that time, BoonEx experinced ups and downs but was seeking for progress always: we\'ve been developing the aeDating software which got high positions and was the most popular dating software. The dating software time passed and now Community sites run the show and we are very excited to deliver the best community software!

        <b>SMTP authentication </b> - most SMTP servers requires SMTP authentication, most probably you need to enable it.
        <br />
        <b>SMTP server name</b> - is it better to send mail from your site SMTP server, so it is probably the name of your site or localhost.
        <br />
        <b>SMTP username/SMTP password</b> - registered email account username and password, it is better to create different account for this purpose, like no-reply@mysite.com.
        <br />
        <b>From name of the message</b> - recipients will see this name as email sender, so it is probably your site name.
        <br />
        <b>Attach every outgoing email all files from kmailer/attach folder</b> - you can upload any files to <b>modules/boonex/smtpmailer/data/attach</b> folder on your site and enable this option setting to attach uploaded files to every email.
        <br />
        <b>Is your SMTP server requires secure connection</b> - you can disable it if your hostname is localhost, secure connection is not needed if you send mails from localhost.
        <br />
        <b>Enable SMTP mailer</b> - it is possible to disable SMTP mailer at all, for example if you have temporary problems with your SMTP server. 
        <br />
        <b>Override default sender email address</b> - set this the same as <b>SMTP username</b> email address, to avoid problems with mail marked as spam.
        <br />
        <br />
        Alternatively, you can get above options from your desktop mail client, if you are going to use the same email address for sending mail from your site.
        
        <hr />

        If emails still go to spam folder, check the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Try to set "Override default sender email address" field the same as "SMTP username" email address</li>
            <li>Make sure that "Override default sender email address" is valid and exists</li>
            <li>Try to change default email templates, it maybe that standard ones can be in spam filters, since they are used on a lot of sites by default</li>
            <li>Ask your members to add your site email to their contacts - when email is in user\'s contact list it always goes to inbox</li>

			<li>Do not delete profile types directly in database.</li>
			<li>Do not edit/delete values of `ProfileType` predefined list ([admin panel -> settings -> predefined values -> ProfileType). However you can reorder rows of that list.</li>
			<li>Do not remove `ProfileType` field from join page. That field should always be on the join page.</li>
			<li>Do not change name, type and values list of `ProfileType` field using fields builder. The only thing you can change is caption and/or description.</li>
			<li>After adding homepage members block you should proceed to [Admin Panel -> Builders -> Page Blocks] page find newly added block in `Inactive Blocks` section and place it on any of the columns.</li>

	<h4>A step by step manual on how to create dependent field:</h4>
	Assume that you want to create a State field which should depend on Country field.
	<ul>
		<li>You need to create dependent values list first. To do that click on a `<strong>New dependent list</strong>` link give it a name (let\'s say <strong>State</strong> and select a list on which new list will be dependent (in our case it should be <strong>Country</strong>). After that a new popup window will open allowing you to add/edit values of a new list.</li>
		<li>After dependent list is ready proceed to <strong>[admin panel -> builders -> profile fields]</strong> and add new field and click on it to bring up field properties form (or edit existing field).</li>
		<li>Set common properties of the field like name, caption, description, etc. `<strong>Type</strong>` should be `<strong>Selector</strong>`, `<strong>Selector Control</strong>` should be `<strong>Select (Dropdown Box)</strong>`.</li>
		<li>Click <strong>Dependencies</strong> tab. Read notes by moving mouse cursor over the blue exclamation marks. Select the field on which new field depends (in our example it should be <strong>Country</strong>). After that select the list of possible values (the one which we have created in first step of this manual). Decide where you need <strong>AJAX</strong> or not. Press Save.</li>
		<li>Done. Not <strong>State</strong> field depends on <strong>Country</strong> field which means that on all pages where <strong>Country/State</strong> pair appears values of <strong>State</strong> field would be loading according to <strong>Country</strong> selected.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Things you shouldn\'t do:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Do not edit list of dependent values at <strong>[admin panel -> settings -> predefined values]</strong>. Edit all dependent lists only at <strong>[admin panel -> modules -> dependent fields]</strong></li>
		<li>Do not leave dependent field on forms without parent field. For example if you have <strong>Country->State</strong> dependency then both of them should always be on all forms (join, edit, search forms).</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Control type on search page:</h4>
	<p>By default all fields of `Select (Dropdown box)` control type appear on search form as multiselectable dropdowns. If you will ever want to remove that ability of multiselection for all dependent fields you can easily do that by editing the file <b>modules/aqb/df/classes/AqbDFConfig.php</b>: at the very top comment out the first line of code and uncomment the second line.</p>
